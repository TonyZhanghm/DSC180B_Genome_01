## Checkpoint-1
- Request data from source: UK Biobank and NIAGADS
- Understand the analysis methods: meta analysis, Manhattan plot, regional association plot. 
- Write a survey of the data you are using, the relationship and appropriateness of the data to the problem under examination, and the context in which the data was created.
- Summarize relevant details of the data generating process, describing the population that the data represents, whether that population is relevant to the question at hand, while addressing possible questions of data reliability.
- Understand how to use population stratification on our data so that it can apply to other races besides European descent.
- no new code added

## Checkpoint-2
- Describe the source of the backup dataset, the population that the data represents, whether that population is relevant to the question at hand, while addressing possible questions of data reliability. (Scott)
- Perform preprocessing quality controls using Plink commands (Jared, Tony)
- Statistically assess the quality of the data (Tony)
- EDA (Barplot, PCA, Scatter matrix plot, Scree Plot) (All)
- Perform multi-covariate association analysis with logistic regression (Tony)
